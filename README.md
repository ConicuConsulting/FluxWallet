FluxWallet is not just a wallet‚Äîit‚Äôs the cornerstone of the next generation of decentralized systems. Built upon **Cube4D**, **Active Graph Networks (AGN)**, and **Dynamic Relationship Expansion (DRE)**, FluxWallet redefines scalability, security, and adaptability while incentivizing **knowledge-building through collaboration**.

## **üöÄ Features**

### **Core System Features**
- **4D DNS Integration**: Hierarchical DNS system for spatial-temporal wallet structures.
- **GitHub OAuth Security**: Robust authentication with multi-factor protocols.
- **Tamper-proof Transactions**: Transactions validated through mathematical checksums and spatial relationships.
- **Horcrux Mechanism**: Decentralized data validation through online/offline nodes.

### **Knowledge-Building Distribution**
FluxWallet rewards users and contributors by:
- **Dynamic Knowledge Contributions**: Users earn Flux for building relationships, expanding the AGNs, and validating data through horcrux mechanisms.
- **Commission on Expansions**: Contributors whose work is expanded upon receive a proportional Flux reward.
- **Transparent Distribution Metrics**: Flux tokens are distributed based on measurable contributions, enabling fair and equitable participation.

## **üåå Flux Distribution Through Knowledge Building**

The ecosystem is designed to encourage collaboration, innovation, and trustless contributions. Users actively engage in:
1. **Knowledge Contribution**:
   - Add validated data, relationships, or context to the AGN ecosystem.
   - Enhance the value of existing nodes through dynamic relationships.

2. **Expansion and Commission**:
   - Contributors earn **Flux tokens** as their knowledge is expanded upon.
   - Transactions between users are validated against these dynamic relationships.

3. **Validation Nodes**:
   - Users act as validators, ensuring the integrity of the data while earning additional rewards.
   - Offline validation is supported for airgapped systems.
